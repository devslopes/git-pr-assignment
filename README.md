## üõ† Requirements

1. Your commits and Pull Request **MUST EXCLUDE** OS generated files/folders and files with sensitive data. (i.e: OS-specific and editor specific settings, debug logs, build tools, etc).

## üìù Instructions

1. Update the `.gitignore` file to ignore OS generated files/folders and files with sensitive data
2. As you make changes to this project, be mindful of the requirements.
3. Create a remote repository for this project on Github.
4. Push this repository from the command line to Github.
   **NOTE:**: When adding this repository to Github, you will need to replace the word `origin` with `destination` (or any other word you wish to use). This is because the remote repository you cloned is already using the name, `origin`.

```
git remote add destination <your_github_repo_url>
git branch -M main
git push -u destination main
```

## ‚éã COMMIT STEPS

1. After making your initial push to your remote repository, create a new branch off your local `main` branch called, `feature/bug-tracking`
2. Create a new file, `.env.production.local`
3. Copy/paste the following sensitive data into, `.env.production.local`:
   `SENTRY_DSN=https://1eb0a2142.ingest.sentry.io/711007`
4. Create a new file, `app.js`
5. Add the following to `app.js`:

```
var loveToCode = true;
var BUG_TRACKING_DNS = process.env.production.local;
```

6. Add the following to `styles.css`:

```
h2 { color: blue; }
```

7. Commit your changes locally. Your commit message should have a subject line and body. It should follow the 7 commit message convention guidelines
8. Push this branch to your remote repository. (This will create a new remote branch). Remember, when you push your code, don't use "origin". Use `destination` (or the whatever word you chose to use when you set up the remote repo)
9. Create a Pull Request for this branch to be merged into `main`
10. To submit your assignment, put the URL of your GitHub repository in a `.txt` file, zip the file and then upload it here so we can verify the commit history is correct. A Devslopes mentor will review your PR (Pull Request), comment as necessary and reject or approve your PR
